# intel_images_classifier

Implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) to solve the image classification problem for Intel's natural scene images. 

To address this problem, you need to use the dataset contained in the "archive.zip" file. 

All the images in this dataset have dimensions of 150 x 150. This dataset was obtained from the following website: Kaggle Intel Image Classification.
